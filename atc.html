            <p>As part of my CAS activities, I volunteered at the [name of ATC center] to assist children with special needs. My role involved helping them with their daily activities, such as arts and crafts, games, and outdoor exercises.</p>
            <p>This experience was incredibly rewarding. It taught me patience, empathy, and the importance of inclusivity. I also learned how small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.</p>
